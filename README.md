# Bloxorz Solver in JavaScript

This JavaScript code provides a simple implementation of the Bloxorz puzzle solver. The Bloxorz puzzle is a classic 2D block puzzle game where the goal is to navigate a rectangular block from its initial position to the exit on a board. The block can be rotated and moved in different directions.

## Key Features

    - __Dynamic Board Rendering__: The code dynamically generates an HTML table to visually represent the game board based on a 2D array input.
    - __Game Board Representation__: The game board is represented using various symbols, including 'B' for the block, 'E' for the exit, and '0' for empty spaces.
    - __Interactive Webpage__: The puzzle solution is displayed on a webpage, allowing users to see the sequence of movements to reach the exit.
    - __Breadth-First Search Algorithm__: The solver utilizes a breadth-first search algorithm to explore possible paths through the game board until it finds a solution to reach the exit.

### How to use

    1. Include the provided HTML code in your project.
    2. Customize the initial game board array (initialBoard) to create different puzzle scenarios.
    3. Open the HTML file in a web browser to visualize the puzzle and see the solution.
